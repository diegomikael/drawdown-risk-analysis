# Drawdown Risk Analysis

This project analyzes historical drawdowns across major asset classes by
decomposing price series into peak–trough–recovery events.

The goal is to compare not just how much assets fall, but how long they take
to recover.

## Key Findings

- Equity indices experience deep drawdowns but typically recover faster.
- Small-cap equities show the largest tail risk.
- Gold exhibits moderate drawdowns but extremely long recovery times.
- Drawdown depth and recovery duration capture distinct dimensions of risk.
